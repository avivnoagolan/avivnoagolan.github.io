            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>The Whisk - Matcha Cafe </p>
            
            <p>The Whisk is a modern matcha cafe rooted in ritual and refined simplicity. Inspired by the quiet art of whisking, we craft each cup with intention — blending tradition, quality ingredients, and thoughtful design. From ceremonial-grade matcha to creative seasonal blends, The Whisk is a space to slow down, reset, and savor something beautifully green. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The Whisk is designed for a generation that values both aesthetics and intention. Our core audience is college students, young professionals, creatives, and wellness-focused individuals who seek an elevated alternative to traditional coffee culture. They appreciate clean design, quality ingredients, and experiences that feel curated rather than rushed.</p>
           
            <p>Our guests are socially aware, the type who notice branding, care about sourcing, and enjoy spaces that photograph beautifully but also feel calm and authentic. They gravitate toward mindful rituals, healthier caffeine options, and cafés that double as creative workspaces or meeting spots.</p>

					<h1> About </h1>
				
					<p>  In America, the bottomless pot of coffee is a symbol of everyday life, and something that every person in every city can picture on cue. What if matcha were just as accessible as that daily cup?

                        Café Matcha brings together the best matcha from all over Japan with the best comforts of the classic American diner.
                        
                        Our goal is simple: to make matcha welcoming, approachable, and yours – enjoyed however you like it.</p>
